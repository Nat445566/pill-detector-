\# üíä Smart Pill Counting System with Streamlit and OpenCV



!\[Pill Counter App Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/\[Nat445566]/\[pill-detector-]/screenshot.png)



A user-friendly web application that allows users to count pills from an uploaded image. By interactively selecting a sample pill, the system leverages OpenCV to automatically detect and count all similar pills, providing a quick and accurate tally.



This project was developed as a practical application of the concepts learned in the "BMDS2133 Image Processing" course.

\## ‚ú® Features



\-   \*\*Interactive Image Upload:\*\* Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats.

\-   \*\*Drawable Canvas for ROI Selection:\*\* Users can easily draw a rectangle on the uploaded image to select a sample pill.

\-   \*\*Automated Object Counting:\*\* Employs a robust image processing pipeline to accurately count objects similar in size to the selected sample.

\-   \*\*Clear Visual Feedback:\*\* The final image displays the counted pills highlighted with green boxes and a clear total count.

\## üß† How It Works: The Image Processing Pipeline



The core logic of the pill counter follows these steps:



1\.  \*\*Image Preprocessing:\*\* The uploaded image is first converted to grayscale to simplify analysis. A Gaussian blur is then applied to reduce noise and smooth edges.

2\.  \*\*Segmentation:\*\* Using \*\*Otsu's Binarization\*\*, the system automatically creates a binary (black and white) mask to separate the pills (foreground) from the background.

3\.  \*\*Noise Removal:\*\* \*\*Morphological Operations\*\* (specifically Opening and Closing) are used to clean the binary mask by removing small noise specks and filling in tiny holes within the pills.

4\.  \*\*Contour Detection:\*\* The application finds the contours (outlines) of all objects in the cleaned mask.

5\.  \*\*Filtering \& Counting:\*\* Each contour is filtered based on its area. Only contours with an area similar to the user-selected sample pill are considered valid. The final count is the number of valid contours found.
